Question 2:

a)
Look at all LHSs (AB, B, BCD, BCDE, BCE, DF)

B->CEF => BCEF
(BCE)F->(BCE)DF => BCDEF
(BCDE)F -> (BCDE)AF => ABCDEF

therefore, B is a key for R
therefore, anything with B is also a key for R

the only LHS without B is DF:
DF->C => CDF
CDF->CDF

therefore DF is NOT a key for R

Therefore, all keys of R are:
B
AB, BC, BD, BE, BF
ABC, ABD, ABE, ABF, BCD, BCE, BCF, BDE, BDF, BEF
ABCD, ABCE, ABCF, BCDE, BCDF, BDEF
ABCDE, ABCDF, BCDEF
ABCDEF
