Question 2:

a)
Look at all LHSs (AB, B, BCD, BCDE, BCE, DF)

B->CEF => BCEF
(BCE)F->(BCE)DF => BCDEF
(BCDE)F -> (BCDE)AF => ABCDEF

therefore, B is a key for R
therefore, anything with B is also a key for R

the only LHS without B is DF:
DF->C => CDF
CDF->CDF

therefore DF is NOT a key for R

Therefore, all keys of R are:
B
AB, BC, BD, BE, BF
ABC, ABD, ABE, ABF, BCD, BCE, BCF, BDE, BDF, BEF
ABCD, ABCE, ABCF, BCDE, BCDF, BDEF
ABCDE, ABCDF, BCDEF
ABCDEF


b)
Since B is a key for R, we can construct the following set of FDs:
{B->A, B->C, B->D, B->E, B->F}
all RHSs are singletons
if we remove any one of these FD, we lose that specific entailment which cannot be constructed with other FDs in the set
all LHSs are signletons as well, therefore no need to test whether removing attributes from LHS will result in minimal basis

therefore, {B->A, B->C, B->D, B->E, B->F} is a minimal basis for S
